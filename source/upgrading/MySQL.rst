|MySQL upgrade problems|
   When upgrading newer CloudStack versions on older MySQL versions, some of the upgrade scripts may not apply fully on the database and some changes will be missing in the resulting installation. 

   some versions of mysql dont apply a sql statement like
   .. parsed-literal::
ALTER TABLE nics MODIFY COLUMN update_time timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

   After the upgrade of CLoudStack and while on one of those versions MySQL, an upgrade to a higher version of MySQL will lead to a broken system.
   The only remedie know is to apply those columns after the MySQL upgrade.
